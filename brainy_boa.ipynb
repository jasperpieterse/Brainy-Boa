    "In this notebook, we will train a neural network to play the Snake game using the Neuroevolution through Augmenting Toplogies (NEAT) algorithm. NEAT is a genetic algorithm that evolves populations of neural networks by altering their weights, biases and topology by crossing over and mutating the neural networks. The best networks get to live and reproduce, producing a more fit offsping. The specific settings that the NEAT algorithm uses can be altered in the 'config-neat' file. For more information on how NEAT works, you can check out the original paper by Stanley and Miikkulainen [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf). \n",

To do this, we will guide you through various experiments with different input and outputs the network receives. The source code for the project can be found within the 'snake_game.py' file."

    "## Tutorial\n",
    "Before we start the experiments, it is useful to explain how the code works. We will first create an instance of the SnakeGame class and run the game for a few steps to see how it works. For now, we will use a simple game without any obstacles. The snake has information on its distance to the wall, distance to it's nearest body segment, and it's distance to the apple in all cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). The snake can also move in any of these directions. We will run the NEAT algorithm 5 times for 30 generations each. From these we obtain a list with the 'statistics' of each run, from which we can extract general information of the run using the [`StatisticsReporter`](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/statistics.html) module of neat-python."

You might have noticed that right now the snake adopts a very simple strategy: it always trails along the wall until it lines up with the apple, and then goes straight for it. We can make it a bit more challenging by adding obstacles to the game.
